# Modeling-Priors-in-Bayesian-Inference-Insights-from-a-Number-Game-Experiment

In this paper, we extend the number game experiment from
Tenenbaum’s “A Bayesian Framework for Concept Learning”
in order to model human priors from empirical data. We construct
a survey to collect empirical data and develop our analysis
using the Bayesian framework. We build out the prior using
a variety of methods that include different interpretations of
the hypothesis space and explore alternative computations of
lambda. Our results show that the perceived complexity of the
hypothesis space seems to influence human decision-making.
